# Tim Superville — Portfolio (developer edition)

This repository contains the React + Vite source for the portfolio site. Use `src/` for edits. The production build outputs to `docs/` (GitHub Pages friendly).

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production (writes to `docs/`):

```bash
npm run build
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate the values you need. Key variables:

- `VITE_GA_ID` (optional) — Google Analytics measurement id
- `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` (optional) — Plausible domain for analytics
- `VITE_CALENDLY_URL` — Scheduler URL used by the "Book a consult" buttons
- `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL` — Email used by the "Email me" quick link
- `VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` — Formspree endpoint or other contact endpoint

Important: do not commit `.env` to the repo.

## `docs/` is build output

Files under `docs/` are generated by `vite build`. Do not edit `docs/index.html` or other files directly — your changes will be overwritten. Edit source files in `src/` and run `npm run build`.

## Analytics debug (dev)

There is a small dev-only overlay that captures calls to `trackEvent` into `window.__analyticsCalls`. It appears automatically when running the dev server.

## CI / Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow installs devDependencies to ensure Tailwind/PostCSS are present before building. The workflow publishes `docs/` to GitHub Pages.

## Next steps you can take

- Provide your scheduling link and contact email and I will wire them into `.env` and verify the build.
- Provide a working Formspree endpoint or ask me to add a small serverless contact function.

_If you edited files in `docs/` manually, copy any content you want to keep into the source files in `src/` before rebuilding._
